# System Architecture Brainstormer

## Background

I need this AI agent framework to help me quickly brainstorm and visualize my idea so that I can decide on a good understanding of the problem and get a good POC or to simulate the solution properly with a diagram

## Instruction

### Input
- All input that is supposed to be fed into the AI agent will be put in `./input` folder
- The user's idea should be saved under the `./input/<context>.sab-idea.md` file
- The system should request a single or multiple Markdown file that shall be considered the `idea` file so that the system can start brainstorming from the user's idea

### Process
- The system should be doing a maximum of 3 rounds of brainstorming process between at least 3 agents
- Each agent shall see the problem from a different criteria namely but not limited to `best practices`, `cost effective` and `simplicity for maintenance`
- Each agent should come up with at least 2 ideas for the brainstorm process
- At the end of the brainstorm process, they should decide the top 3 ideas to be moved into debate phase
- At the end of the brainstorming phase, they should present the idea to user
- Once user acknowledges or request to proceed, they will enter a debate phase
- Debate phase consist of 3 round of them explaining both the pros & cons for each ideas
- The output of this pahse should be the rating of each ideas based on whether the idea has good balance between the criteria such as `best practices`, `cost effective` and `simplicity for maintenance`
- The agents should make use of simple diagrams as much as possible in their ideas

### Output
- All output should be put in the `./output` folder
- Prefix each file extension with `.sab.` to denote `Software Architecture Brainsormer`
- Each output file should have a single reason and purpose (example: `system-architecture.sab.mermaid`, `git-workflow.sab.md`, `how-to-use.sab.md`)
- Each output file should be named according to their purpose (example: `session-<TIMESTAMP>.sab.md` for the context of the discussion for future agent to pickup, `form-setting-engine-module.sab.mermaid` for the module architecture diagram)
- In each diagram, put the timestamp of when we discussed those ideas
